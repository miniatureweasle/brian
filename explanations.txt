Django Commands


Pipenv shell (a program you must install)
 This creates a virtual python enviornament just in the directory which you call the command
 A virtual environament is like a mini python installation within that directory
 The reason you do this is so that you can install any published python programs (eg, django, django rest framework)
 easily.
 You can also run many python applications independently with different packages using this method


python manage.py startproject hike_service
This creates the django project and sets up the inital directories


python manage.py createapp core
Django has a concept of apps which descripe certain funcitons of your appplication
You create this to make it easier to maintain
