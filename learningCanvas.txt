Canvas notes so far.

When creating a canvas first
you need an html file that contains the canvas elelment with a locating id
Then you need your js file

const canvas = document.getElementById('CanvasLocatingID') //this is one method of locating it there are many others

with this you can set the context the height and width (Probably more)

the width and height can be set as follows

canvas.width = window.innerHeight
canvas.height = window.innerWidth

The context of the canvas is set like this, its inportant to make the varaible small since you will use it alot to draw all your images.

ctx = canvas.getContext('2D');

Drawing in blocks

ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);

in order to color the above block you can use this.

ctx.fillStyle = 'blue/rgb/hexadecimal';

(Note: this can be specified before each new instance of a fillrect or other drawing function: this will change the color for the block that follows this line of code.)

Drawing lines

when drawings lines or a series of lines you must always begin your code with the following.

ctx.beginPath();

then the starting point for the line

ctx.moveTo(x, y);

for subsiquint lines you can make use of 

ctx.lineTo(x, y);

In order for the above to actually appear on a canvas you have to make use of the following after each instance of drawing

ctx.stroke();

drawing circles and arcs

ctx.arc(x, y, radius, angle of arc in radians, boolean for clockwise or counterclockwise);

(Note: arcs require beginPath() and stroke() just like lines.)
